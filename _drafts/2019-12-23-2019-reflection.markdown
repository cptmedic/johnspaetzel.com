It's coming up on the end of 2019 and as usual it's time to reflect on the previous year.

Checkout some of the previous years: 
* [2018 Retrospective](2018-retrospective)
* [2017 - Wear some flowers in your hair](2017-wear-flowers-in-your-hair)
* [2016 A Full Stack Year](2016-a-full-stack-year)

# Travel

Google Maps has a fabulous feature... It tracks your location everywhere all the time. It's kinda creepy but I actually love it. So here's a map of almost everywhere I went in 2019.

There's too many individual locations to list so instead how about some stats?
* Trips (Overnight): 16
* Flight Segments: 43
* Cruises: 2
* Ubers & Lyfts: 93
* States: 11
* Countries: 5

# Goals

At the beginning of 2019 I had some specific goals in mind and ehh, I did alright.
* Exercise: I've been exercising less not more as intended. Down to about 1 day or less a week so there is definitely room to improve. 
* Writing: This makes the 6th blog post of the year, a far cry from weekly but they were spaced out throughout the year so the consistency has been pretty good. I also refreshed the style of this blog pretty substantially.
* Finishing: I didn't release the beach app. It's barely received any attention at all so I should probably work on that.
* Reading: I haven't really been reading more. But not less either?
* Plants: I bought 3 plants and they are all still alive!
* Travel: Blew this one out of the water and went on a ton of trips.
* Social: Traveled quite a bit with friends & made some new ones along the way. I'm in a pretty good place socially right now.
