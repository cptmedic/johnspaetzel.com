# Changes since last year
 - Removed Visual Studio versions 2013 & 2015, I now use 2017 for all of my .NET projects. 
 - Removed Atom in favor of lighter editors, mainly Visual Studio Code and Notepad++. Atom feels as big and sluggish as an IDE but without the advantages of a full IDE. So i've stopped using it entirely. 
 - Removed Cygwin which I have not been using
 - Added Bash for Windows which is incredibly useful since you have all of the advantages that come with the ubuntu ecosystem.
 - Added powershell finally and use it pretty frequently for general operations. 
 - Added Application Insights more frequently then New Relic and have moved most of my monitoring there. I still prefer New Relic for database server and instance monitoring.
 - Added NPM which is the defacto standard for JavaScript packages. I also now use it to start my frontend apps, run test frameworks, and initiate builds for them. It's also very useful for random other commands like rimraf.
 - Added a few new search tools for windows, Everything for global searches & AstroGrep for more specific querying. 
 - Added Discord for gaming related voice and text chat. 
 - Removed Google Tasks. I'm finally used to using Google Keep and have entirely converted to it.
 - Added Feedly for RSS feed reading.
 - Added several tools which are not new to me, but were just not on this list. Gimp, Ditto and Bulk Rename Utility.
 - Added Calibre which I have finished importing my ebook library into. I keep the library synced between systems with google drive.
