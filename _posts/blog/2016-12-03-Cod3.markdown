Cod3 estimates the response time of EMS and police to any specific point in the city of Virginia Beach using publically available data sources.

Cod3 was created during the Dominion Enterprise Hack Data event on December 2nd and 3rd of 2016. The name is a play on the emergency services code for flashing lights and sirens (Code 3).
